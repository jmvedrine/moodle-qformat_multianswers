This is a Moodle plugin to import multianswer (cloze) questions in the question bank.
It similar to the core multianswer question import format but able to import several multianswer questions.
You must prepare a text file with your multianswers questions and separate each question with
//NEWCLOZEQUESTION
alone on a line.
This system was chosen rather than a blank line to permit import of cloze questions with blank lines in the question text.
